description: 'Slides from a lecture presentation covering the following topics: Atomic
  arrangement of the solid surface, why is the state of the surface important in tribology,
  progress due to the availability of instrumentation, modification of the surface
  through the use

  of coating techniques, general Ccaracteristics of (metals, polymers, ceramics),
  general characteristics of (composites, solid surface), electric double layer, role
  of lubricants, mechanical properties of the surface, image force on dislocations
  near the surface, and thermodynamic analysis of an interface.'
