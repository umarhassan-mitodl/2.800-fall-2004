description: 'Slides from a lecture presentation covering the following topics: Applications
  of polymeric bearings, tribological applications of polymeric

  "bearing" in medicine and related areas, common plastics used in tribology, structure
  of some common polymers, properties of polymers, friction and wear mechanisms of
  PTFE, friction and wear mechanisms of UHMWPE, friction and wear mechanisms of other
  ductile thermoplastics, composite materials to reduce the Wear rate, wear volume
  and friction coefficient of steel-nylon composite pairs at various sliding speeds,
  crack depth as a function of friction coefficient, basic mechanism of friction in
  polymers, single deflected fiber, minimization of wear of composites, wear particles
  of UHMWPE measured with AFM, effect of different sterilization of UHMWPE on its
  wear rate, other treat techniques for low friction and wear.'
