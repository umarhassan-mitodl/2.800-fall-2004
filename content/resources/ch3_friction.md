  macroscale sliding contacts, coefficient of friction versus sliding distance, effect
  of removing wear particles, friction at dry sliding interface, experimental setup,
  Specimens, wear track, particle (SiC) insertion, six stages in the frictional force
  versus distance slid relationship, two interacting surface asperities, geometrically
  compatible slip-line field, effect of boundary lubrication, friction in geometrically
  confined space, friction at polymeric interfaces, structure of some thermoplastics,
  friction coefficient of low density polyethylene, frictional behavior of composites,
  effect of coatings on friction, and conclusions.'
