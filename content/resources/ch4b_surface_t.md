description: 'Slides from a lecture presentation covering the following topics: Response
  of materials, point force applied to a semi-infinite elastic solid, trajectory of
  principal stresses due to a point force, contour of principal normal stresses, Hertzian
  contact, location of the max. radial stress, stress field due to line load, semi-infinite
  elastic solid loaded by a elliptical distributed load, contour and variation of
  stress, crack growth of hertzian crack, and sequence of crack formation and growth
  events during loading and unloading.'
